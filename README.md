@author: danielkotas

This script downloads Tweets of Jim Cramer, a finance TV-personality famous for being consistently wrong
in his stock recommendations.

Subsequently, the script analyses which stock (if any) is being mentioned in a given tweet and
assigns a sentiment to determine going long/short the stock.

Lastly, a simple trading strategy is devised based on Jim's recommendations.
